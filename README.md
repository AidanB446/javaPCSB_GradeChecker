# javaPCSB_GradeChecker

Uses selenium web browser automation to check PCSB students grades, (through focus). Has a full GUI.
Useful if you dont wanna open a web browser to check grades.

download Selenium Webdriver jar files here : https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/



This will be changed soon to using Maven dependency manager, because so many .jar files in lib is ugly, and kinda ruins the project.
